# Feedback from Review Session with NRCan Risk Team 
###(Notes accompanying Wireframe_User_Comments.pdf)

##Landing Page
 *Note [page 1]:* Strong consensus from our risk team to modify high-level structure of site, and to use different labels to clarify what content should be expected on each page.

See notes on overall structure below


 *Note [page 1]:* This could be a rotating image panel that showcases different hotspot areas of concern (cities) across Canada - either as evocative photos, as you have shown here), or as lightly annotated photos that highlight hazard of concern for these different cities.  Clicking on one of the rotating images would take the user straight to the region of interest in the ‘Hazard Threat’ section where they can then expulsion specific hazards of concern.

 *Note [page 1]:* Remove search bar — introduces too much confusion up front about what results would be returned 

 *Note [page 1]:* Strong consensus from risk team that focus of landing page should be to help users self-identify as one of our primary audience types. Selection could be made using icons with an option to choose whether to go first to an overview (as below), or straight to the most relevant section of the website. 

 *Text [page 1]:* Resident/Business Owner

 *Text [page 1]:* Domain Expert

 *Text [page 1]:* Community Planner / Emergency Manager

 *Note [page 1]:* We discussed the possibility of using the MyRisk section as a high-level introduction to the content on this site — perhaps as a cascading story map that provides enough context to allow people to get the whole picture before diving into the details.  Sections of the cascading story map would mirror the overall site structure, and the user could jump to the relevant section of interest from any point within the story map experience. 

This would mean moving the content currently in ‘My Risk’ to other sections.  For example, the neighbourhood component of ‘MyRisk’ could move to ‘Community Profile’ The detailed earthquake risk for a selected building type could move to the section on earthquake risk.

 *Note [page 1]:* Strong support for motion graphics to help foreshadow what the user is likely to experience.  We also discussed the possibility of creating a tutorial for each section, similar to what climate data.ca has done to help the user understand how to navigate and access content for each section

##Overall Site Structure
 *Note [page 2]:* General feedback from our Risk team is that the tab labels need to be more readily understandable to a general audience — suggested moving the multi-hazard component currently under ‘Human Settlement’ to it’s own section called ‘Hazard Threats’

 *Text [page 2]:* MyRisk

 *Text [page 2]:* Hazard Threats

 *Text [page 2]:* Earthquake Risk

 *Text [page 2]:* Indicators

 *Text [page 2]:* CommunityProfile

 *Note [page 2]:* Strong support for including these sections - similar to what climate data.ca has done.  Our intent is to provide a companion site that is similar to and complements ClimateData.ca, by focusing on disaster risk reduction

Our team will develop the content for the about sections, the resource sections and a glossary of relevant terms used on this site

 *Text [page 2]:* Search for a region and/or location
of interest

 *Rectangle [page 2]:* 
 *Text [page 2]:* Clicking on a map feature returns a thumbnail sketch of relevant information

 *Rectangle [page 2]:* 
 *Text [page 2]:* User selects content to be displayed in the main map or chart frame. Chart and map features are interactive, referencing the same underlying data 

 *Text [page 2]:* Translucent side panel pull-out to allow user to select additional indicators to load into the view. Each indicator card would need to have an option to make visible, or to hide so that user has control over what content they are interacting with any any given part of their exploration 

 *Text [page 2]:* Map or Chart frame for displaying content for a given region and/or theme of interest.  

Web maps are fully interactive. User can pan, zoom and add additional reference layers as in most web mapping interfaces. Can include button for printing the page content, and/or clipping out a portion of the map as an image for use in other graphics applications


Charts are the primary focus of the Risk Metrics tab.  This is where users would go to interact with detailed statistical information for a region and theme of interest.

 *Text [page 2]:* Selections can be made using a variety of drop-down menus, accordion boxes, radio buttons and check boxes

 *Text [page 2]:* Chart and/or table information for a selected region/theme of interest. Initial load will contain a default set of  relevant’ indicator cards’ for a given theme.  However, we need an option for the user to select additional indicator cards to load into the page.  This frame will need to be scrollable to accommodate additional content that the user chooses to add

 *Text [page 2]:* Translucent pop-up window provides access to map legend and short description of the information being presented in the map frame.
 
##Notes from 1A-MyRisk-neighbourhood
 *Note [page 3]:* Move this content to the ‘Community Profile’ section.

 *Note [page 3]:* Move this content to the ‘Hazard Threat’ section
 
##Notes from 1A-MyRisk-earthquake
 *Note [page 4]:* Move this section to the ‘Earthquake Risk’ section
##Notes from 2A-human-settlement-land use
 *Note [page 5]:* Change the section title to ‘Community Profile’  The content here will focus on physical exposure (buildings & people), and social fabric at the neighbourhood level.

 *Note [page 5]:* Support for allowing users to choose from a limited set of related map layers —possibly as overlays to help explore relationships between physical exposure and social vulnerability
##Notes from 2C-human-settlement-hazard-threat
 *Note [page 7]:* Move this content to ‘Hazard Threat’ section’
 *Note [page 7]:*Request to include a thumbnail of the selected scenario to make sure users are connecting impacts & consequences to the corresponding earthquake hazard scenario
##Notes from 3A-earthquak-scenario-risk
 *Note [page 8]:* Will need to clearly distinguish between probabilistic risk (aka seismic risk) and single event earthquake risk scenarios (scenario risk).  

The user should have the option of accessing information at whatever scale is of interest to them.  This could be a profile of earthquake risk for the whole country, or for any level of aggregation (zoom scale) of interest.

We can also allow the user to zoom into a specific neighbourhood level. At this zoom scale, we would swarth the mode of interaction so that users are selecting risk results for a building type of interest.
##Notes from 3A-earthquak-scenario-risk
 *Note [page 9]:* A recommendation to have a single slider bar (preferably vertical orientation) that allows users to explore anticipated impacts and consequences for existing conditions, and to evaluate opportunities for risk reduction across all indicators and related map by moving the slider bar to different levels of mitigation. 
##Notes from 3B-earthquak-scenario-risk
 *Note [page 10]:* Side-bar translucent pull-out may be a way to allow users to select additional risk indicator cards.
##Notes from 4-risk-metrics
 *Note [page 11]:* We have combined the ‘Risk Metric’ and ‘Open Data’ functions into a single section by adding a ‘cart’ icon that allows users to directly select the underlying datasets for access through OpenData options, and to choose whether they want just the map data (JSON format), the  attribute data (CSV format) or both.

Once the user has made a selection of datasets, they would go to the My Cart page which would either direct them to where to find/download the data
##Additional Notes
 *Note [page 12]:* Strong support for including a ‘Resources’ link that directs users to something similar to the climate data ‘Training page’

 *Note [page 13]:* We will need something similar to provide an overview of the project.  I like the cascading page format for this content



 *Note [page 14]:* we will need a section that provides a clear definition of all terms used on the site.

 *Note [page 15]:* Strong support for a simple tutorial function that helps users understand how to interact with the content in each section — perhaps very similar to what Climate Data has implemented
